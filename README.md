## Short description

This project was built by [Razvan D](https://github.com/RazvanD30) as part of Team Project Course during 5th semester of CS BSc at Babes-Bolyai University Cluj Napoca. This was just an MVP to work on, but the project was droped and we decided to continue working with .NET Core framework.

The course was led by Dan Mircea Suciu (ex-Director at 3Pillar and one of the best teachers in University)

The aims of the Course were to create a team work environment similar to the one on the market using technologies, frameworks, tools, techniques and principles such as: Agile Software Development (story points, iterations, demos and deliverables), Task Management tools (Trello), the definition of done, task ownership, OpenUP ( stakeholder, project manager, developer, team leader), VCS (Git, GitHub), Initial domain model, architectural modeling (UML diagrams for use case scenarios other architectural diagrams), databases (data access object layer, DB architecture normalization, DBMS), project planning (priority, severity, estimation), TDD (didn't really aproach this for our project).

I took the position of Scrum master and/or team leader and some of the responsabilities I had to take: organizing and ensuring standards and understanding on the taskboard, keeping an ongoing discussion with each member of the team, keeping the team together (all of us were employed, some had less free time, some more; I needed to show patience, compassion and I needed to read lecture on how to keep up as an SM), contribute continously in the development process (I was not a boss, I was a teammember and I had my tasks on backend, frontend and back-front integration). 
I wouldn't say I was the best SM or team leader, but I definetly tried to improve, I accepted negative feedback and tried to change for the best.
I could apply SAFe concepts (Scaled Agile Framework) from my job into this project and I had a good chance to change my perspective from being a team member at work into being a team leader in this project.
Also had to present the final demo in front of the evaluation comission. (not the best demo I had, caused by technical internet issues, but my charisma helped us a little bit we got a good grade)
